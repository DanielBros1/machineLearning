## Machine Learning 2025

##### Task 1 - Linear Regression



✅ Use the cross-validation method to test the linear regression with different   values, at least three.

✅ Implement a SGD method that will train the Lasso regression for 10 epochs.

✅ Extend the Fisher’s classifier to work with two features. Use the class as the  .

##### Task 2 - Clustering


✅ Modify the HCM code to work for three groups. This exercise can be divded into four tasks:

✅ For density clustering, plot the feature space with all element marked with different color, depending on the cluster that it’s assigned to. You should do the following tasks:

✅ Build a method that plot baed on dendrograms_history and pydot, a dendrogram for the divisive clustering method. You should base on agglomerative method, but keep in mind that it works top-down instead of bottom-up. This exercise need just one function to be implemented:

✅ Implement the $s_{2}$ metric

✅ Draw the borders between clusters in the output image (for 5.0 grade)

##### Task 3 - Decision Trees

✅ Rewrite the CART method to the Gini index.

✅ Use pydot do draw the tree for C4.5 example.

✅ Implement the minimum number of objects pruning method.

✅ Plot OC1 tree, but instead of elements id, print the feature id it was split by.

##### Task 4 - Support Vector Machines

✅  Implement the polynomial kernel.

✅  Implement the multiclass C-SVM.
