## Machine Learning 2025


##### Task 1 - Linear Regression

✅ Use the cross-validation method to test the linear regression with different   values, at least three.

✅ Implement a SGD method that will train the Lasso regression for 10 epochs.

✅ Extend the Fisher’s classifier to work with two features. Use the class as the  .


##### Task 2 - Clustering

✅ Modify the HCM code to work for three groups. This exercise can be divded into four tasks:

✅ For density clustering, plot the feature space with all element marked with different color, depending on the cluster that it’s assigned to. You should do the following tasks:

✅ Build a method that plot baed on dendrograms_history and pydot, a dendrogram for the divisive clustering method. You should base on agglomerative method, but keep in mind that it works top-down instead of bottom-up. This exercise need just one function to be implemented:

✅ Implement the $s_{2}$ metric

✅ Draw the borders between clusters in the output image (for 5.0 grade)


##### Task 3 - Decision Trees

✅ Rewrite the CART method to the Gini index.

✅ Use pydot do draw the tree for C4.5 example.

✅ Implement the minimum number of objects pruning method.

✅ Plot OC1 tree, but instead of elements id, print the feature id it was split by.


##### Task 4 - Support Vector Machines

✅ Implement the polynomial kernel.

✅ Implement the multiclass C-SVM


##### Task 5 - Ensemble methods

✅ Find the best three classifier in the stacking method using the classifiers from scikit-learn package.

✅ Build arcing arc-x4 method..


##### Task 6 - NLP

✅ Build your own tokenizer, where you need to implement two functions to implement a tokenizer based on regular expression.

✅ Get tags from Trump speech.

✅ Get the nouns in the last 10 sentences from Trump's speech and find the nouns divided by sentencens. Use SpaCy.

✅ Build your own Bag Of Words implementation using tokenizer created before.

✅ Build a 5-gram model and clean up the results.
